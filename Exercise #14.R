# MR With Product Terms

# (1) Regress S on H, G, and H*G. What are the coefficients, and p-values for them?

# (2) Recode G, such that if the original G is 1, now it's 0, and vice versa.

# (3) regress S on H, G, and H*G. This is the same as (1) except that we're now using the recoded G.

# (4) Describe what changed, and didn't change, from the result from (1).
 
# (5) What is the meaning of the coefficient for H now? What was the meaning of the coefficient for H before recoding?
 
# (6) Center H. Run the regression above. What is the meaning of the coefficient for G now?
